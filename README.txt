Space to Shoot is a top down cooperative shooter game where both players can press Space to Shoot. To make matters more complicated, bullets always shoot towards the other player, and since either death loses the entire game, friendly-fire becomes a big issue. The goal of the game is to get players to learn to kill enemies while communicating with each other whether or not they have the Space to Shoot.
